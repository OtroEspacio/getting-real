I was keen to read Getting Real by the guys at 37Signals since I found it was 
available for free online. But I prefer reading on my Kindle these days, and 
since there didn't seem to be any compatible formats available on their site
 and I was bored, I thought I'd scrape the HTML version and take it from there. 

The result is a MOBI version of Getting Real which works on my Kindle and 
behaves reasonably well, thanks to Calibre's conversion smarts. Check it out.

I did this mainly to procrastinate from studying. Now I can put it off further
while I read the book :)
