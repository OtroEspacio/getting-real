Keep the Posts Coming
=====================

Show your product is alive by keeping an ongoing product development blog post-launch
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don\'t stop blogging once you launch. Show your product is a living
creature by keeping a dedicated blog that you update frequently (at
least once a week, more often if you can).

Things to include:

-   Faq
-   How-tos
-   Tips & tricks
-   New features, updates, & fixes
-   Buzz/press

A blog not only shows your app is alive, it makes your company seem more
human. Again, don\'t be afraid to keep the tone friendly and personal.
Small teams sometimes feel like they need to sound big and
ultra-professional all the time. It\'s almost like a business version of
the Napoleon Complex. Don\'t sweat sounding small. Revel in the fact
that you can talk to customers like a friend.

### It\'s Alive

A frequently-updated product blog is the best indicator that a webapp is
in active development, that it\'s loved and that there\'s a light on at
home. An abandoned product blog is a sign of an abandoned product, and
says the people in charge are asleep at the wheel.

Keep the conversation going with your users on your product blog, and be
transparent and generous with the information you share. Let your
company\'s philosophies shine through. Openly link and discuss
competitors. Hint at upcoming features and keep comments open for
feedback.

A living product is one that\'s talking and listening to its users. A
frequently-updated product blog promotes transparency, a sense of
community and loyalty to your brand. Extra, free publicity is a bonus.

As editor at Lifehacker, I scan the product blogs of webapps I love
continuously --- like Google, Flickr, Yahoo, del.icio.us, and 37signals
product blogs. I\'m much more likely to mention them than webapps that
send out one-sided press releases out of the blue and don\'t maintain an
open conversation with their users and fans.
