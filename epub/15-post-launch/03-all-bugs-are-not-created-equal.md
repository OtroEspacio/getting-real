All Bugs Are Not Created Equal
==============================

Prioritize your bugs (and even ignore some of them)
---------------------------------------------------

Just because you discover a bug in your product, doesn\'t mean it\'s
time to panic. All software has bugs --- it\'s just a fact of life.

You don\'t have to fix each bug instantly. Most bugs are annoying, not
destroying. Annoyances can be tabled for a bit. Bugs that result in \"it
doesn\'t look right\" errors or other misdemeanor miscues can safely be
set aside for a while. If a bug destroys your database, though, you
obviously need to fix it immediately.

Prioritize your bugs. How many people are affected? How bad is the
problem? Does this bug deserve immediate attention or can it wait? What
can you do right now that will have the greatest impact for the greatest
number of people? Often times adding a new feature may even be more
important to your app than fixing an existing bug.

Also, don\'t create a culture of fear surrounding bugs. Bugs happen.
Don\'t constantly seek someone to blame. The last thing you want is an
environment where bugs are shoved under the rug instead of openly
discussed.

And remember what we said earlier about the importance of honesty. If
customers complain about a bug, be straight up with them. Tell them
you\'ve noted the issue and are dealing with it. If it won\'t be
addressed right away, explain why and say you\'re focusing on areas of
the product that affect a greater number of people. Honesty is the best
policy.
