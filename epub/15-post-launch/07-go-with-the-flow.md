Go With the Flow
================

Be open to new paths and changes in direction
---------------------------------------------

Part of the beauty of a web app is its fluidity. You don\'t wrap it up
in a box, ship it, and then wait years for the next release. You can
tweak and change as you go along. Be open to the fact that your original
idea may not be your best one.

Look at Flickr. It began as a multiplayer online game called The Game
Neverending. Its creators soon realized the photo-sharing aspect of the
game was a more plausible product than the game itself (which was
eventually shelved). Be willing to admit mistakes and change course.

Be a surfer. Watch the ocean. Figure out where the big waves are
breaking and adjust accordingly.
