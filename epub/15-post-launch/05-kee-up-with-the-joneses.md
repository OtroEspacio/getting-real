Subscribe to news feeds about your competitors

Subscribe to news feeds about both your product and your competitors
(it\'s always wise to know the ways of one\'s enemy). Use services like
PubSub, Technorati, Feedster, and others to stay up to date (for
keywords, use company names and product names). With RSS, this
constantly changing info will be delivered right to you so you\'re
always up to speed.
