Better, Not Beta
================

Don't use "beta" as a scapegoat
----------------------------------

These days it feels like everything is in beta stage forever. That's a
cop out. An interminable beta stage tells customers you're not really
committed to rolling out a finished product. It says, "Use this, but if
it's not perfect, it's not our fault."

Beta passes the buck to your customers. If you're not confident enough
about your release then how can you expect the public to be? Private
betas are fine, public betas are bullshit. If it's not good enough for
public consumption don't give it to the public to consume.

Don't wait for your product to reach perfection. It's not gonna
happen. Take responsibility for what you're releasing. Put it out and
call it a release. Otherwise, you're just making excuses.
