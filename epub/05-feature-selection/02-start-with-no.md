Start With No
=============

Make features work hard to be implemented
-----------------------------------------

The secret to building half a product instead of a half-ass product is
saying no.

Each time you say yes to a feature, you're adopting a child. You have
to take your baby through a whole chain of events (e.g. design,
implementation, testing, etc.). And once that feature's out there,
you're stuck with it. Just try to take a released feature away from
customers and see how pissed off they get.

Don't be a yes-man
-------------------

Make each feature work hard to be implemented. Make each feature prove
itself and show that it's a survivor. It's like "Fight Club." You
should only consider features if they're willing to stand on the porch
for three days waiting to be let in.

That's why you start with no. Every new feature request that comes to
us --- or from us --- meets a no. We listen but don't act. The initial
response is "not now." If a request for a feature keeps coming back,
that's when we know it's time to take a deeper look. Then, and only
then, do we start considering the feature for real.

And what do you say to people who complain when you won't adopt their
feature idea? Remind them why they like the app in the first place.
"You like it because we say no. You like it because it doesn't do 100
other things. You like it because it doesn't try to please everyone all
the time."
