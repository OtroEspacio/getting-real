Optimize for Happiness
======================

Choose tools that keep your team excited and motivated
------------------------------------------------------

A happy programmer is a productive programmer. That\'s why we optimize
for happiness and you should too. Don\'t just pick tools and practices
based on industry standards or performance metrics. Look at the
intangibles: Is there passion, pride, and craftmanship here? Would you
truly be happy working in this environment eight hours a day?

This is especially important for choosing a programming language.
Despite public perception to the contrary, they are not created equal.
While just about any language can create just about any application, the
right one makes the effort not merely possible or bearable, but pleasant
and invigorating. It\'s all about making the little details of daily
work enjoyable.

Happiness has a cascading effect. Happy programmers do the right thing.
They write simple, readable code. They take clean, expressive, readable,
elegant approaches. They have fun.

We found programming bliss in the language Ruby and passed it on to
other developers with our framework Rails. Both share a mission
statement to optimize for humans and their happiness. We encourage you
to give that combination a spin.

In summary, your team needs to work with tools they love. We\'ve talked
here in terms of programming languages, but the concept holds true for
applications, platforms, and anything else. Choose the fuse that gets
people excited. You\'ll generate excitement and motivation and a better
product as a result.
