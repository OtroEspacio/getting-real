Code Speaks
===========

Listen when your code pushes back
---------------------------------

Listen to your code. It will offer suggestions. It will push back. It
will tell you where the pitfalls reside. It will suggest new ways to do
things. It will help you stick to a model of less software.

Is a new feature requiring weeks of time and thousands of lines of code?
That\'s your code telling you there\'s probably a better way. Is there a
simple way to code something in one hour instead of a complicated way
that will take ten hours? Again, that\'s your code guiding you. Listen.

Your code can guide you to fixes that are cheap and light. Pay attention
when an easy path emerges. Sure, the feature that\'s easy to make might
not be exactly the same as the feature you originally had in mind but so
what? If it works well enough and gives you more time to work on
something else, it\'s a keeper.

### Listen up

Don\'t worry about design, if you listen to your code a good design will
appear\...Listen to the technical people. If they are complaining about
the difficulty of making changes, then take such complaints seriously
and give them time to fix things.

Dead?](http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html))

### If Programmers Got Paid To Remove Code\...

If programmers got paid to remove code from sofware instead of writing
new code, software would be a whole lot better.
