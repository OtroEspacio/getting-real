What is Getting Real?
=====================

Want to build a successful web app? Then it's time to Get Real. Getting
Real is a smaller, faster, better way to build software.

- Getting Real is about skipping all the stuff that represents real
    (charts, graphs, boxes, arrows, schematics, wireframes, etc.) and
    actually building the real thing.
- Getting real is less. Less mass, less software, less features, less
    paperwork, less of everything that's not essential (and most of
    what you think is essential actually isn't).
- Getting Real is staying small and being agile.
- Getting Real starts with the interface, the real screens that people
    are going to use. It begins with what the customer actually
    experiences and builds backwards from there. This lets you get the
    interface right before you get the software wrong.
- Getting Real is about iterations and lowering the cost of change.
    Getting Real is all about launching, tweaking, and constantly
    improving which makes it a perfect approach for web-based software.
- Getting Real delivers just what customers need and eliminates
    anything they don't.

The benefits of Getting Real
----------------------------

Getting Real delivers better results because it forces you to deal with
the actual problems you're trying to solve instead of your ideas about
those problems. It forces you to deal with reality.

Getting Real foregoes functional specs and other transitory
documentation in favor of building real screens. A functional spec is
make-believe, an illusion of agreement, while an actual web page is
reality. That's what your customers are going to see and use. That's
what matters. Getting Real gets you there faster. And that means you're
making software decisions based on the real thing instead of abstract
notions.

Finally, Getting Real is an approach ideally suited to web-based
software. The old school model of shipping software in a box and then
waiting a year or two to deliver an update is fading away. Unlike
installed software, web apps can constantly evolve on a day-to-day
basis. Getting Real leverages this advantage for all its worth.

> ### How To Write Vigorous Software
>
> Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary
> words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a
> drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary
> parts. This requires not that the writer make all sentences short or
> avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, but that every word
> tell.

No more bloat
-------------

The old way: a lengthy, bureaucratic,
we're-doing-this-to-cover-our-asses process. The typical result:
bloated, forgettable software dripping with mediocrity. Blech.

Getting Real gets rid of...
----------------------------

-   Timelines that take months or even years
-   Pie-in-the-sky functional specs
-   Scalability debates
-   Interminable staff meetings
-   The "need" to hire dozens of employees
-   Meaningless version numbers
-   Pristine roadmaps that predict the perfect future
-   Endless preference options
-   Outsourced support
-   Unrealistic user testing
-   Useless paperwork
-   Top-down hierarchy

You don't need tons of money or a huge team or a lengthy development
cycle to build great software. Those things are the ingredients for
slow, murky, changeless applications. Getting real takes the opposite
approach.

In this book we'll show you...
--------------------------------

-   The importance of having a philosophy
-   Why staying small is a good thing
-   How to build less
-   How to get from idea to reality quickly
-   How to staff your team
-   Why you should design from the inside out
-   Why writing is so crucial
-   Why you should underdo your competition
-   How to promote your app and spread the word
-   Secrets to successful support
-   Tips on keeping momentum going after launch
-   ...and lots more

The focus is on big-picture ideas. We won't bog you down with detailed
code snippets or css tricks. We'll stick to the major ideas and
philosophies that drive the Getting Real process.

Is this book for you?
---------------------

You're an entrepreneur, designer, programmer, or marketer working on a
big idea.

You realize the old rules don't apply anymore. Distribute your software
on cd-roms every year? How 2002. Version numbers? Out the window. You
need to build, launch, and tweak. Then rinse and repeat.

Or maybe you're not yet on board with agile development and business
structures, but you're eager to learn more.

**If this sounds like you, then this book is for you.**

Note: While this book's emphasis is on building a web app, a lot of
these ideas are applicable to non-software activities too. The
suggestions about small teams, rapid prototyping, expecting iterations,
and many others presented here can serve as a guide whether you're
starting a business, writing a book, designing a web site, recording an
album, or doing a variety of other endeavors. Once you start Getting
Real in one area of your life, you'll see how these concepts can apply
to a wide range of activities.
