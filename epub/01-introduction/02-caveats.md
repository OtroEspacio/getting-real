Caveats, disclaimers, and other preemptive strikes
==================================================

Just to get it out of the way, here are our responses to some complaints
we hear every now and again:

"These techniques won't work for me."
----------------------------------------

Getting real is a system that's worked terrifically for us. That said,
the ideas in this book won't apply to every project under the sun. If
you are building a weapons system, a nuclear control plant, a banking
system for millions of customers, or some other life/finance-critical
system, you're going to balk at some of our laissez-faire attitude. Go
ahead and take additional precautions.

And it doesn't have to be an all or nothing proposition. Even if you
can't embrace Getting Real fully, there are bound to be at least a few
ideas in here you can sneak past the powers that be.

"You didn't invent that idea."
---------------------------------

We're not claiming to have invented these techniques. Many of these
concepts have been around in one form or another for a long time. Don't
get huffy if you read some of our advice and it reminds you of something
you read about already on so and so's weblog or in some book published
20 years ago. It's definitely possible. These techniques are not at all
exclusive to 37signals. We're just telling you how we work and what's
been successful for us.

"You take too much of a black and white view."
------------------------------------------------

If our tone seems too know-it-allish, bear with us. We think it's
better to present ideas in bold strokes than to be wishy-washy about it.
If that comes off as cocky or arrogant, so be it. We'd rather be
provocative than water everything down with "it depends..." Of course
there will be times when these rules need to be stretched or broken. And
some of these tactics may not apply to your situation. Use your
judgement and imagination.

"This won't work inside my company."
---------------------------------------

Think you're too big to Get Real? Even Microsoft is Getting Real (and
we doubt you're bigger than them).

Even if your company typically runs on long-term schedules with big
teams, there are still ways to get real.The first step is to break up
into smaller units. When there's too many people involved, nothing gets
done. The leaner you are, the faster— and better— things get done.

Granted, it may take some salesmanship. Pitch your company on the
Getting Real process. Show them this book. Show them the real results
you can achieve in less time and with a smaller team.

Explain that Getting Real is a low-risk, low-investment way to test new
concepts. See if you can split off from the mothership on a smaller
project as a proof of concept. Demonstrate results.

Or, if you really want to be ballsy, go stealth. Fly under the radar and
demonstrate real results. That's the approach the Start.com team has
used while Getting Real at Microsoft. "I've watched the Start.com team
work. They don't ask permission," says Robert Scoble, Technical
Evangelist at Microsoft. "They have a boss that provides air cover. And
they bite off a little bit at a time and do that and respond to
feedback."
