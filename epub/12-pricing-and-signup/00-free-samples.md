Free Samples
============

Give something away for free
----------------------------

It\'s a noisy world out there. In order to get people to notice you amid
the din, give something away for free.

Smart companies know giving away freebies is a great way to lure in
customers. Look at Apple. They offer iTunes software for free in order
to build demand for the iPod and the iTunes music store. In the offline
world, retail outlets do the same. Starbucks says a new purchase is
stimulated for every five beverage samples they give away to customers.
Not too shabby.

For us, Writeboard and Ta-da list are completely free apps that we use
to get people on the path to using our other products. Also, we always
offer some sort of free version of all our apps.

We want people to experience the product, the interface, the usefulness
of what we\'ve built. Once they\'re hooked, they\'re much more likely to
upgrade to one of the paying plans (which allow more projects or pages
and gives people access to additional features like file uploading and
ssl data encryption).

> Make bite-size chunks: Devise specialized, smaller offerings to get
> customers to bite. Resolve to sub-divide at least one product or service
> into bite-size chunks that are inexpensive, easy or fun.

> ### Give Away Your Hit Single
> 
> Consider giving one of your songs (per-album) as a free promotional
> download to the world --- to be like the movie trailer --- like the hit
> single sent to radio --- the song that makes people want to go buy your
> music.
> 
> Don\'t worry about piracy for this song. Let people play it, copy it,
> share it, give it away. Have the confidence that if the world heard it,
> they will pay for more.
