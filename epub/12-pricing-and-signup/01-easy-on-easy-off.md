Easy On, Easy Off

Make signup and cancellation a painless process
-----------------------------------------------

Make it as easy as possible to get in --- and get out --- of your app.

If I\'m a customer that wants to use your app, it should be a painless,
no-brainer process. Provide a big, clear, signup button that pops and
put it on each page of your marketing site. Tell folks how easy it is:
\"From sign-up to login in just 1 minute!\"

There should always be a free option so customers can demo the app
without entering credit card information. Some of our competitors
require a call back, an appointment, or a special password in order to
try their product. What\'s the deal with that? We let anyone try our
apps for free at any time.

Keep the signup form as short as possible. Don\'t ask for stuff you
don\'t need and don\'t throw a long daunting form at people.

The same principles hold true for the cancellation process. You never
want to \"trap\" people inside your product. While we\'re sorry when
people decide to cancel their Basecamp account, we never make that
process intimidating or confusing. \"Cancel my account\" is a link
that\'s clear as day on a person\'s account page. There shouldn\'t be
any email to send, special form to fill out, or questions to answer.

Also, make sure people can get their data out if they decide to leave.
We make sure customers can easily export all messages and comments in
xml format at any time. It\'s their data and they should be able to do
with it what they want.

This is crucial because giving people control over their information
builds trust. You\'re giving them a bridge to their data island. You\'re
allowing them to leave without penalty if they find a better offer.
It\'s the right thing to do and it builds goodwill.
