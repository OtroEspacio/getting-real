A Softer Bullet

Soften the blow of bad news with advance notice and grandfather clauses
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Need to deliver bad news like a price increase? Make it as painless as
possible by giving folks plenty of advance notice. Also, consider a
grandfather period that exempts existing customers for a certain period
of time. These folks are your bread and butter and you want to make them
feel valued, not gouged.
