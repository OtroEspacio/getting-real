Silly Rabbit, Tricks are for Kids
=================================

Avoid long-term contracts, sign-up fees, etc.
---------------------------------------------

No one likes long term contracts, early termination fees, or one time
set-up fees. So avoid them. Our products bill on a month to-month basis.
There's no contract to sign and you can cancel at any time without
penalty. And there are never any set-up fees.

Don't try to find "tricky" ways to get more cash. Earn it.
