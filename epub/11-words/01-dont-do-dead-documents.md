Don\'t Do Dead Documents
========================

Eliminate unnecessary paperwork
-------------------------------

Avoiding functional specs is a good start but don\'t stop there; Prevent
excess paperwork everywhere. Unless a document is actually going to
morph into something real, don\'t produce it.

Build, don\'t write. If you need to explain something, try mocking it up
and prototyping it rather than writing a longwinded document. An actual
interface or prototype is on its way to becoming a real product. A piece
of paper, on the other hand, is only on its way to the garbage can.

Here\'s an example: If a wireframe document is destined to stop and
never directly become the actual design, don\'t bother doing it. If the
wireframe starts as a wireframe and then morphs into the actual design,
go for it.

Documents that live separately from your application are worthless. They
don\'t get you anywhere. Everything you do should evolve into the real
thing. If a document stops before it turns real, it\'s dead.
