Tell Me a Quick Story
=====================

Write stories, not details
--------------------------

If you do find yourself requiring words to explain a new feature or
concept, write a brief story about it. Don\'t get into the technical or
design details, just tell a quick story. Do it in a human way, like you
would in normal conversation.

It doesn\'t need to be an essay. Just give the flow of what happens. And
if you can include the brief story in context with screens you are
developing, all the better.

Stick to the experience instead of getting hung up on the details. Think
strategy, not tactics. The tactics will fall into place once you begin
building that part of your app. Right now you just want to get a story
going that will initiate conversation and get you on the right track.
