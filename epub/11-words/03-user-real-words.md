Use Real Words
==============

Insert actual text instead of lorem ipsum
-----------------------------------------

Lorem ipsum dolor is a trusted friend of designers. Dummy text helps
people get what the design will look like once it\'s fleshed out. But
dummy text can be dangerous too.

Lorem ipsum changes the way copy is viewed. It reduces text-based
content to a visual design element --- a shape of text --- instead of
what it should be: valuable information someone is going to have to
enter and/or read. Dummy text means you won\'t see the inevitable
variations that show up once real information is entered. It means you
won\'t know what it\'s like to fill out forms on your site. Dummy text
is a veil between you and reality.

You need real copy to know how long certain fields should be. You need
real copy to see how tables will expand or contract. You need real copy
to know what your app truly looks like.

As soon as you can, use real and relevant words. If your site or
application requires data input, enter the real deal. And actually type
in the text --- don\'t just paste it in from another source. If it\'s a
name, type a real name. If it\'s a city, type a real city. If it\'s a
password, and it\'s repeated twice, type it twice.

Sure, it\'s easier to just run down the forms and fill the fields with
garbage (\"asdsadklja\" \"123usadfjasld\" \"snaxn2q9e7\") in order to
plow through them quickly. But that\'s not real. That\'s not what your
customers are going to do. Is it really smart to take a shortcut when
customers are forced to take the long road? When you just enter fake
copy in rapid-fire fashion, you don\'t know what it really feels like to
fill out that form.

Do as your customers do and you\'ll understand them better. When you
understand them better, and feel what they feel, you\'ll build a better
interface.
