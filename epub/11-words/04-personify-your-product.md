Personify Your Product
======================

What is your product\'s personality type?
-----------------------------------------

Think of your product as a person. What type of person do you want it to
be? Polite? Stern? Forgiving? Strict? Funny? Deadpan? Serious? Loose? Do
you want to come off as paranoid or trusting? As a know-it-all? Or
modest and likable?

Once you decide, always keep those personality traits in mind as the
product is built. Use them to guide the copywriting, the interface, and
the feature set. Whenever you make a change, ask yourself if that change
fits your app\'s personality.

Your product has a voice --- and it\'s talking to your customers 24
hours a day.
