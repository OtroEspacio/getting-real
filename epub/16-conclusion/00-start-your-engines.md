Start Your Engines
==================

Done!
-----

Alright, you made it! Hopefully you\'re psyched to start Getting Real
with your app. There really has never been a better time to make great
software with minimal resources. With the right idea, passion, time, and
skill, the sky\'s the limit.

A few closing thoughts:

Execution
---------

Everyone can read a book. Everyone can come up with an idea. Everyone
has a cousin that\'s a web designer. Everyone can write a blog. Everyone
can hire someone to hack together some code.

The difference between you and everyone else will be how well you
execute. Success is all about great execution.

For software, that means doing a lot of things right. You can\'t just
have good writing but then fail to deliver on the promises in your
prose. Clean interface design won\'t cut it if your code is full of
hacks. A great app is worthless if poor promotion means no one ever
knows about it. To score big, you have to combine all these elements.

The key is balance. If you tilt too far in one direction, you\'re headed
for failure. Constantly seek out your weak links and focus on them until
they\'re up to par.

People
------

It\'s worth reemphasizing the one thing that we think is the most
important ingredient when it comes to building a successful web app: the
people involved. Mantras, epicenter design, less software, and all these
other wonderful ideas won\'t really matter if you don\'t have the right
people on board to implement them.

You need people who are passionate about what they do. People who care
about their craft --- and actually think of it as a craft. People who
take pride in their work, regardless of the monetary reward involved.
People who sweat the details even if 95% of folks don\'t know the
difference. People who want to build something great and won\'t settle
for less. People who need people. OK, not really that last one but we
couldn\'t resist throwing a little Streisand into the mix. Anyhow, when
you find those people, hold onto them. In the end, the folks on your
team will make or break your project --- and your company.

More Than Just Software
-----------------------

It\'s also worth noting that the concept of Getting Real doesn\'t apply
just to building a web app. Once you start grasping the ideas involved,
you\'ll see them all over the place. Some examples:

-   Special ops forces, like the Green Berets or Navy Seals, use small
    teams and rapid deployment to accomplish tasks that other units are
    too big or too slow to get done.
-   The White Stripes embrace constraints by sticking to a simple
    formula: two people, streamlined songs, childlike drumming, keeping
    studio time to a minimum, etc.
-   Apple\'s iPod differentiates itself from competitors by not offering
    features like a built-in fm radio or a voice recorder.
-   Hurry up offenses in football pick up big chunks of yards by
    eliminating the \"bureaucracy\" of huddles and play-calling.
-   Rachael Ray bases her successful cookbooks and TV show on the
    concept of 30-minute \"Get Real Meals.\"
-   Ernest Hemingway and Raymond Carver used simple, clear language yet
    still delivered maximum impact.
-   Shakespeare reveled in the limitations of sonnets, fourteen-line
    lyric poems in iambic pentameter.
-   And on and on\...

Sure, Getting Real is about building great software. But there\'s no
reason why it needs to stop there. Take these ideas and try applying
them to different aspects of your life. You might just stumble upon some
neat results.
