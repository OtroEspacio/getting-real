Name Hook
=========

Give your app a name that's easy to remember
---------------------------------------------

A big mistake a lot of people make is thinking their app's name needs
to be ultradescriptive. Don't worry about picking a name that vividly
describes your tool's purpose; That usually just leads to a generic,
forgettable name. Basecamp is a better name than something like Project
Management Center or ProjectExpress. Writeboard is better than
CollaborEdit.

Also, don't focus group or committee-ize the naming process too much.
Pick a name that's short, catchy, and memorable and then run with it.

And don't sweat it if you can't get the exact domain name you want.
You can always be creative and get close with a couple of extra letters
(e.g. backpackit.com or campfirenow.com).
