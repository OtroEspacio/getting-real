A Powerful Promo Site
=====================

Go from teaser to preview to launch
-----------------------------------

The best promotional tool is a great product. Word will get out if
you\'ve got an app that people find really useful.

Still, you need an ace promotional site too. What should you include on
this site? Some ideas:

-   **Overview**: Explain your app and its benefits.
-   **Tour**: Guide people through various features.
-   **Screen captures and videos**: Show people what the app actually
    looks like and how to use it.
-   **Manifesto**: Explain the philosophy and ideas behind it.
-   **Case Studies**: Provide real life examples that show what\'s
    possible.
-   **Buzz**: Testimonial quotes from customers, reviews, press, etc.
-   **Forum**: Offer a place for members of the community to help one
    another.
-   **Pricing & Sign-up**: Get people into your app as quickly as
    possible.
-   **Weblog**: Blogs keep your site fresh with news, tips, etc.
