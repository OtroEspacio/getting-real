Promote Through Education
=========================

Share your knowledge with the world
-----------------------------------

When a teacher appears as a contestant on Jeopardy, Alex Trebek often
comments that it\'s a \"noble profession.\" He\'s right. There\'s
definitely something wonderful and rewarding about sharing your
knowledge with others. **And when the subject you\'re teaching is your
app, it serves a dual purpose: You can give something back to the
community that supports you and score some nice promotional exposure at
the same time.**

As a promotional technique, education is a soft way to get your name ---
and your product\'s name --- in front of more people. And instead of a
hard sell \"buy this product\" approach, you\'re getting attention by
providing a valuable service. That creates positive buzz that
traditional marketing tactics can\'t match. People who you educate will
become your evangelists.

Education can come in many forms. Post tips and tricks at your site that
people will want to share with others. Speak at conferences and stay
afterwards to meet and greet with attendees. Conduct workshops so
curious fans can learn more and talk to you in the flesh. Give
interviews to publications. Write articles that share helpful
information. And write books. ;)

An example from our own history is the Yellow Fade Technique, a method
we invented to subtly spotlight a recently changed area on a page. We
wrote a post about it on Signal vs. Noise. That post made the rounds and
got thousands and thousands of page views (to this day it\'s doing huge
traffic).

The post worked on both an educational and a promotional level. A lesson
was learned and a lot of people who never would have known about our
products were exposed to them. Another example: During our development
of Ruby on Rails, we decided to make the infrastructure open source. It
turned out to be a wise move. We gave something back to the community,
built up goodwill, garnered recognition for our team, received useful
feedback, and began receiving patches and contributions from programmers
all over the world.

Teaching is all about good karma. You\'re paying it forward. You\'re
helping others. You get some healthy promotion. And you can even bask in
a bit of nobility. So what do you know that the world wants to hear
about?
