Feature Food
============

They\'re hungry for it so serve it up
-------------------------------------

New or interesting features are a great way to generate buzz for your
application. Special interest groups love to chew up \"feature food\"
and spit it back out to the community. Alright, that\'s kind of an
unpleasant analogy but you get the point.

For example, by using Ruby on Rails, a new development platform, we
generated a ton of attention for Basecamp within the developer
community.

The Ajax elements we used in our applications got lots of buzz and even
led to Business 2.0 magazine naming 37signals a \"key player in Ajax\"
alongside big names like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and Amazon.

Another example: Bloggers took notice of Basecamp\'s RSS support since
it was one of the first business examples of RSS.

iCal integration, a seemingly minor feature, got us press on a ton of
Mac-related sites which probably never would have mentioned the app
otherwise.

Small teams have a leg up on integrating new ideas into software. While
bigger companies have to deal with bureaucratic bottlenecks, you can
rapidly implement new ideas and get attention for using them.

Riding the hype coattails of the technology du jour is an effective and
cheap way to build your buzz. That said, don\'t go adding the latest
obscure technology just to gain some notice. But if you are using
something new or noteworthy, go ahead and spotlight it for special
interest groups.
