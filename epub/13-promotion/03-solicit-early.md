Get advance buzz and signups going ASAP

We\'ve already touched on it but it bears repeating: Get some sort of
site up and start collecting emails as soon as possible. Pick your
domain name and put up a logo and maybe a sentence or two that
describes, or at least hints at, what your app will do. Then let people
give you their email address. Now you\'re on your way to having a
foundation of folks ready and waiting to be notified of your launch.
