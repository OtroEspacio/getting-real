Shrink Your Time
================

Break it down
-------------

Estimates that stretch into weeks or months are fantasies. The truth is
you just don\'t know what\'s going to happen that far in advance.

So shrink your time. Keep breaking down timeframes into smaller chunks.
Instead of a 12 week project, think of it as 12 weeklong projects.
Instead of guesstimating at tasks that take 30+ hours, break them down
into more realistic 6-10 hour chunks. Then proceed one step at a time.

The same theory applies to other problems too. Are you facing an issue
that\'s too big to wrap your mind around? Break it down. Keep dividing
problems into smaller and smaller pieces until you\'re able to digest
them.

> the task turned out to be more complex than it seemed. Plus, who can

> be (and why), you can work together to develop a shared understanding
> about the true factors behind the numbers.

> ### Solve The One Problem Staring You in the Face

> My absolute favorite thing to happen on the web in recent memory is the
> release and adoption of the \"nofollow\" attribute. Nobody talked about
> it beforehand. There were no conferences or committees where a bunch of
> yahoos could debate its semantic or grammatical nature. No rfc that
> could turn a simple idea into a 20-line xml snippet I\'d have to read up
> on just to figure out how to use, and then not use because I wasn\'t
> sure if I was formatting for version .3 or 3.3b.
> 
> It\'s simple, it\'s effective, it provided an option for people who
> wanted an option --- and that is far more important when dealing with a
> population of the web that doesn\'t care about specifications or
> deference.
> 
> Sometimes solving the next twenty problems is not as useful or as
> prudent as solving the one staring us right in the face. It wasn\'t just
> a small victory against spam (all victories against spam are small), but
> a victory for those of us who enjoy the simple and swift results that
> being a web developer is all about.
