Avoid Preferences
=================

Decide the little details so your customers don\'t have to
----------------------------------------------------------

You\'re faced with a tough decision: how many messages do we include on
each page? Your first inclination may be to say, \"Let\'s just make it a
preference where people can choose 25, 50, or 100.\" That\'s the easy
way out though. Just make a decision.

Preferences are a way to avoid making tough decisions
-----------------------------------------------------

Instead of using your expertise to choose the best path, you\'re leaving
it in the hands of customers. It may seem like you\'re doing them a
favor but you\'re just making busy work for them (and it\'s likely
they\'re busy enough). For customers, preference screens with an endless
amount of options are a headache, not a blessing. Customers shouldn\'t
have to think about every nitty gritty detail --- don\'t put that burden
on them when it should be your responsibility.

Preferences are also evil because they create more software. More
options require more code. And there\'s all the extra testing and
designing you need to do too. You\'ll also wind up with preference
permutations and interface screens that you never even see. That means
bugs that you don\'t know about: broken layouts, busted tables, strange
pagination issues, etc.

Make the call
-------------

Make simple decisions on behalf of your customers. That\'s what we did
in Basecamp. The number of messages per page is 25. On the overview
page, the last 25 items are shown. Messages are sorted in reverse
chronological order. The five most recent projects are shown in the
dashboard. There aren\'t any options. That\'s just the way it is.

Yes, you might make a bad call. But so what. If you do, people will
complain and tell you about it. As always, you can adjust. Getting Real
is all about being able to change on the fly.
