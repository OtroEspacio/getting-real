"Done!"
=========

Decisions are temporary so make the call and move on
----------------------------------------------------

Done. Start to think of it as a magical word. When you get to done it
means something's been accomplished. A decision has been made and you
can move on. Done means you're building momentum.

But wait, what if you screw up and make the wrong call? It's ok. **This
isn't brain surgery, it's a web app.** As we keep saying, you'll
likely have to revisit features and ideas multiple times during the
process anyway. No matter how much you plan you're likely to get half
wrong anyway. So don't do the "paralyis through analysis" thing. That
only slows progress and saps morale.

Instead, value the importance of moving on and moving forward. Get in
the rhythm of making decisions. Make a quick, simple call and then go
back and change that decision if it doesn't work out.

Accept that decisions are temporary. Accept that mistakes will happen
and realize it's no big deal as long as you can correct them quickly.
Execute, build momentum, and move on.
