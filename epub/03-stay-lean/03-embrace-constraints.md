Embrace Constraints
===================

Let limitations guide you to creative solutions
-----------------------------------------------

There\'s never enough to go around. Not enough time. Not enough money.
Not enough people.

*That\'s a good thing.*

Instead of freaking out about these constraints, embrace them. Let them
guide you. Constraints drive innovation and force focus. Instead of
trying to remove them, use them to your advantage.

When 37signals was building Basecamp, we had plenty of limitations. We
had:

-   A design firm to run
-   Existing client work
-   A 7-hour time difference (David was doing the programming in
    Denmark, the rest of us were in the States)
-   A small team
-   No outside funding

We felt the \"not enough\" blues. So we kept our plate small. That way
we could only put so much on it. We took big tasks and broke them up
into small bits that we tackled one at a time. We moved step by step and
prioritized as we went along.

That forced us to come up with creative solutions. We lowered our cost
of change by always building less software. We gave people just enough
features to solve their own problems their own way --- and then we got
out of the way. The time difference and distance between us made us more
efficient in our communication. Instead of meeting in person, we
communicated almost exclusively via im and email which forced us to get
to the point quickly.

Constraints are often advantages in disguise. Forget about venture
capital, long release cycles, and quick hires. Instead, work with what
you have.
