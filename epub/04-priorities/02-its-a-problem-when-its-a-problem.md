It\'s a Problem When It\'s a Problem
====================================

Don\'t waste time on problems you don\'t have yet
-------------------------------------------------

Do you really need to worry about scaling to 100,000 users today if it
will take you two years to get there?

Do you really have to hire eight programmers if you only need three
today?

Do you really need 12 top-of-the-line servers now if you can run on two
for a year?

Just Wing It
------------

People often spend too much time up front trying to solve problems they
don\'t even have yet. Don\'t. Heck, we launched Basecamp without the
ability to bill customers! Since the product billed in monthly cycles,
we knew we had a 30-day gap to figure it out. We used that time to solve
more urgent problems and then, after launch, we tackled billing. It
worked out fine (and it forced us into a simple solution without
unnecessary bells and whistles).

Don\'t sweat stuff until you actually must. Don\'t overbuild. Increase
hardware and system software as necessary. If you\'re slow for a week or
two it\'s not the end of the world. Just be honest: explain to your
customers you\'re experiencing some growing pains. They may not be
thrilled but they\'ll appreciate the candor.

Bottom Line: Make decisions just in time, when you have access to the
real information you need. In the meanwhile, you\'ll be able to lavish
attention on the things that require immediate care.
