Make Opinionated Software
=========================

Your app should take sides
--------------------------

Some people argue software should be agnostic. They say it\'s arrogant
for developers to limit features or ignore feature requests. They say
software should always be as flexible as possible.

We think that\'s bullshit. The best software has a vision. The best
software takes sides. When someone uses software, they\'re not just
looking for features, they\'re looking for an approach. They\'re looking
for a vision. Decide what your vision is and run with it.

And remember, if they don\'t like your vision there are plenty of other
visions out there for people. Don\'t go chasing people you\'ll never
make happy.

A great example is the original wiki design. Ward Cunningham and friends
deliberately stripped the wiki of many features that were considered
integral to document collaboration in the past. Instead of attributing
each change of the document to a certain person, they removed much of
the visual representation of ownership. They made the content ego-less
and time-less. They decided it wasn\'t important who wrote the content
or when it was written. And that has made all the difference. This
decision fostered a shared sense of community and was a key ingredient
in the success of Wikipedia.

Our apps have followed a similar path. They don\'t try to be all things
to all people. They have an attitude. They seek out customers who are
actually partners. They speak to people who share our vision. You\'re
either on the bus or off the bus.
