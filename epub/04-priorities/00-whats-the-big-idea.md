What\'s the Big Idea?
=====================

Explicitly define the one-point vision for your app
---------------------------------------------------

What does your app stand for? What\'s it really all about? Before you
start designing or coding anything you need to know the purpose of your
product --- the vision. Think big. Why does it exist? What makes it
different than other similar products?

This vision will guide your decisions and keep you on a consistent path.
Whenever there\'s a sticking point, ask, \"Are we staying true to the
vision?\"

Your vision should be brief too. A sentence should be enough to get the
idea across. Here\'s the vision for each of our products:

-   **Basecamp**: Project management is communication
-   **Backpack**: Bring life\'s loose ends together
-   **Campfire**: Group chat over IM sucks
-   **Ta-da List**: Competing with a post-it note
-   **Writeboard**: Word is overkill

With Basecamp, for example, the vision was \"Project management is
communication.\" We felt strongly that effective communication on a
project leads to collective ownership, involvement, investment, and
momentum. It gets everyone on the same page working toward a common
goal. We knew if Basecamp could accomplish this, everything else would
fall in line.

This vision led us to keep Basecamp as open and transparent as possible.
Instead of limiting communication to within a firm, we gave clients
access too. We thought less about permissions and more about encouraging
all participants to take part. The vision is why we skipped charts,
graphs, tables, reports, stats, and spreadsheets and instead focused on
communication priorities like messages, comments, to-do lists, and
sharing files. Make the big decision about your vision upfront and all
your future little decisions become much easier.

> Andy Hunt and I once wrote a debit card transaction switch. A major

> transaction applied to their account twice. In other words, no matter
> what sort of failure mode might happen, the error should be on the side
> of not processing a transaction rather than processing a duplicate
> transaction.

> Together, these laws gave our application strong internal coherence and
> great external consistency.

> Organizations need guideposts. They need an outline; employees need to

> should be short and sweet, and all encompassing: Why do you exist? What
> motivates you? I call this a mantra --- a three or four-word description
> of why you exist.
