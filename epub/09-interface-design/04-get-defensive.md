Design for when things go wrong
-------------------------------

Let\'s admit it: Things will go wrong online. No matter how carefully
you design your app, no matter how much testing you do, customers will
still encounter problems. So how do you handle these inevitable
breakdowns? With defensive design.

Defensive design is like defensive driving. The same way drivers must
always be on the lookout for slick roads, reckless drivers, and other
dangerous scenarios, site builders must constantly search for trouble
spots that cause visitors confusion and frustration. Good site defense
can make or break the customer experience.

We could fill a separate book with all the things we have to say about
defensive design. In fact, we already have. \"Defensive Design for the
Web\" is the title and it\'s a great resource for anyone who wants to
learn how to improve error screens and other crisis points.

Remember: Your app may work great 90% of the time. But if you abandon
customers in their time of need, they\'re unlikely to forget it.
