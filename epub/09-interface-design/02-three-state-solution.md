Three State Solution
====================

Design for regular, blank, and error states
-------------------------------------------

For each screen, you need to consider three possible states:

-   **Regular**\
    The screen people see when everything\'s working fine and your app
    is flush with data.
-   **Blank**\
    The screen people see when using the app for the first time, before
    data is entered.
-   **Error**\
    The screen people see when something goes wrong.

The regular state is a no-brainer. This is the screen where you\'ll
spend most of your time. But don\'t forget to invest time on the other
states too (see the following essays for more on this).
