Hire Less and Hire Later
========================

Add slow to go fast
-------------------

There's no need to get big early --- or later. Even if you have access
to 100 of the very best people, it's still a bad idea to try and hire
them all at once. There's no way that you can immediately assimilate
that many people into a coherent culture. You'll have training
headaches, personality clashes, communication lapses, people going in
different directions, and more.

So don't hire. Really. Don't hire people. Look for another way. Is the
work that's burdening you really necessary? What if you just don't do
it? Can you solve the problem with a slice of software or a change of
practice instead?

Whenever Jack Welch, former CEO of GE, used to fire someone, he didn't
immediately hire a replacement. He wanted to see how long he could get
along without that person and that position. We're certainly not
advocating firing people to test this theory, but we do think Jack is on
to something: You don't need as many people as you think.

If there's no other way, then consider a hire. But you should know
exactly who to get, how to introduce them to the work, and the exact
pain you expect them to relieve.
