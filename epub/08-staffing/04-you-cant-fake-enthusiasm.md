You Can\'t Fake Enthusiasm
==========================

Go for happy and average over frustrated and great
--------------------------------------------------

Enthusiasm. It\'s one attribute you just can\'t fake. When it comes time
to hire, don\'t think you need a guru or a tech-celebrity. Often,
they\'re just primadonnas anyway. A happy yet average employee is better
than a disgruntled expert.

Find someone who\'s enthusiastic. Someone you can trust to get things
done when left alone. Someone who\'s suffered at a bigger, slower
company and longs for a new environment. Someone who\'s excited to build
what you\'re building. Someone who hates the same things you hate.
Someone who\'s thrilled to climb aboard your train.

> ### Extra points for asking questions
> 
> Observe whether a potential hire asks a lot of questions about your
> project. Passionate programmers want to understand a problem as well as
> possible and will quickly propose potential solutions and improvements,
> which leads to a lot of questions. Clarifying questions also reveal an
> understanding that your project could be implemented thousands of
> different ways and it\'s essential to nail down as explicitly as
> possible exactly how you imagine your web app working. As you dig into
> the details, you\'ll develop a sense of whether the person is a good
> cultural match.
