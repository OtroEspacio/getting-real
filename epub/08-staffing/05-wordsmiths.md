Hire good writers
-----------------

If you are trying to decide between a few people to fill a position,
always hire the better writer. It doesn\'t matter if that person is a
designer, programmer, marketer, salesperson, or whatever, the writing
skills will pay off. Effective, concise writing and editing leads to
effective, concise code, design, emails, instant messages, and more.

That\'s because being a good writer is about more than words. Good
writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand.
They can put themselves in someone else\'s shoes. They know what to
omit. They think clearly. And those are the qualities you need.

> ### An Organized Mind
> 
> Good writing skills are an indicator of an organized mind which is
> capable of arranging information and argument in a systematic fashion
> and also helping (not making) other people understand things. It spills
> over into code, personal communications, instant messaging (for those
> long-distance collaborations), and even such esoteric concepts as
> professionalism and reliability.

> ### Clear Writing Leads To Clear Thinking
> 
> Clear writing leads to clear thinking. You don\'t know what you know
> until you try to express it. Good writing is partly a matter of
> character. Instead of doing what\'s easy for you, do what\'s easy for
> your reader.
