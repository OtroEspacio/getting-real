Actions, Not Words
==================

Judge potential tech hires on open source contributions
-------------------------------------------------------

The typical method of hiring for technical positions --- based on
degrees, resumés, etc. --- is silly in a lot of ways. Does it really
matter where someone\'s degree is from or their GPA? Can you really
trust a résumé or a reference?

Open source is a gift to those who need to hire technical people. With
open source, you can track someone\'s work and contributions --- good
and bad --- over a lengthy period of time.

That means you can judge people by their actions instead of just their
words. You can make a decision based on the things that really matter:

-   **Quality of work**\
    Many programmers can talk the talk but trip when it comes time to
    walk the walk. With open source, you get the nitty gritty specifics
    of a person\'s programming skills and practices.
-   **Cultural perspective**\
    Programing is all about decisions. Lots and lots of them. Decisions
    are guided by your cultural vantage point, values, and ideals. Look
    at the specific decisions made by a candidate in coding, testing,
    and community arguments to see whether you\'ve got a cultural match.
    If there\'s no fit here, each decision will be a struggle.
-   **Level of passion**\
    By definition, involvement in open source requires at least some
    passion. Otherwise why would this person spend free time sitting in
    front of a screen? The amount of open source involvement often shows
    how much a candidate truly cares about programming.
-   **Completion percentage**\
    All the smarts, proper cultural leanings, and passion don\'t amount
    to valuable software if a person can\'t get stuff done.
    Unfortunately, lots of programmers can\'t. So look for that zeal to
    ship. Hire someone who needs to get it out the door and is willing
    to make the pragmatic trade-offs this may require.
-   **Social match**\
    Working with someone over a long period of time, during both
    stress/relaxation and highs/lows, will show you their real
    personality. If someone\'s lacking in manners or social skills,
    filter them out.

When it comes to programmers, we only hire people we know through open
source. We think doing anything else is irresponsible. We hired Jamis
because we followed his releases and participation in the Ruby
community. He excelled in all the areas mentioned above. It wasn\'t
necessary to rely on secondary factors since we could judge him based on
what really matters: the quality of his work.

And don\'t worry that extra-curricular activities will take focus and
passion away from a staffer\'s day job. It\'s like the old cliché says:
If you want something done, ask the busiest person you know. Jamis and
David are two of the heaviest contributors to Rails and still manage to
drive 37signals technically. People who love to program and get things
done are exactly the kind of people you want on your team.

### Open Source Passion

What you want the most from a new hire is passion for what he does, and
there\'s no better way of showing it than a trace of commitment in open
source projects.
