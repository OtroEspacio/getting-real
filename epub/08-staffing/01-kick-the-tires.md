Kick the Tires
==============

Work with prospective employees on a test-basis first
-----------------------------------------------------

It\'s one thing to look at a portfolio, résumé, code example, or
previous work. It\'s another thing to actually work with someone.
Whenever possible, take potential new team members out for a \"test
drive.\"

Before we hire anyone we give them a small project to chew on first. We
see how they handle the project, how they communicate, how they work,
etc. Working with someone as they design or code a few screens will give
you a ton of insight. You\'ll learn pretty quickly whether or not the
right vibe is there.

Scheduling can be tough for this sort of thing but even if it\'s for
just 20 or 40 hours, it\'s better than nothing. If it\'s a good or bad
fit, it will be obvious. And if not, both sides save themselves a lot of
trouble and risk by testing out the situation first.

### Start small

Try a small test assignment to start. Don\'t leap in with all of your
work at once. Give your new \[virtual assistant\] a test project or two
to work on and see how the chemistry develops. In the beginning, it\'s
too easy to gloss over potential problems with rose-colored glasses.
Make it clear this is a test run.
