Get Well Rounded Individuals
============================

Go for quick learning generalists over ingrained specialists
------------------------------------------------------------

We\'ll never hire someone who\'s an information architect. It\'s just
too overly specific. With a small team like ours, it doesn\'t make sense
to hire people with such a narrowly defined skill-set.

Small teams need people who can wear different hats. You need designers
who can write. You need programmers who understand design. Everyone
should have an idea about how to architect information (whatever that
may mean). Everyone needs to have an organized mind. Everyone needs to
be able to communicate with customers.

And everyone needs to be willing and able to shift gears down the road.
Keep in mind that small teams often need to change direction and do it
quickly. You want someone who can adjust and learn and flow as opposed
to a stick-in-the-mud who can do only one thing.
