Don\'t split into silos
-----------------------

Too many companies separate design, development, copywriting, support,
and marketing into different silos. While specialization has its
advantages, it also creates a situation where staffers see just their
own little world instead of the entire context of the web app.

As much as possible, integrate your team so there\'s a healthy
back-and-forth dialogue throughout the process. Set up a system of
checks and balances. Don\'t let things get lost in translation. Have
copywriters work with designers. Make sure support queries are seen by
developers.

Even better, hire people with multiple talents who can wear different
hats during development. The end result will be a more harmonious
product.
