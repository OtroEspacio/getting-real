Meetings Are Toxic
==================

Don\'t have meetings
--------------------

Do you really need a meeting? Meetings usually arise when a concept
isn\'t clear enough. Instead of resorting to a meeting, try to simplify
the concept so you can discuss it quickly via email or im or Campfire.
The goal is to avoid meetings. Every minute you avoid spending in a
meeting is a minute you can get real work done instead.

There\'s nothing more toxic to productivity than a meeting. Here\'s a
few reasons why:

-   They break your work day into small, incoherent pieces that disrupt
    your natural workflow
-   They\'re usually about words and abstract concepts, not real things
    (like a piece of code or some interface design)
-   They usually convey an abysmally small amount of information per
    minute
-   They often contain at least one moron that inevitably gets his turn
    to waste everyone\'s time with nonsense
-   They drift off-subject easier than a Chicago cab in heavy snow
-   They frequently have agendas so vague nobody is really sure what
    they are about
-   They require thorough preparation that people rarely do anyway

For those times when you *absolutely must* have a meeting (this should
be a rare event), stick to these simple rules:

-   Set a 30 minute timer. When it rings, meeting\'s over. Period.
-   Invite as few people as possible.
-   Never have a meeting without a clear agenda.

> There are too many meetings. Push back on meetings that do not make

> important business issue to discuss and you want or need input,
> approval, or agreement. Even then, resist the urge to invite everyone
> and their brother --- don\'t waste people\'s time unnecessarily.

> ### Break it Down

> As projects grow, adding people has a diminishing return. One of the
> most interesting reasons is the increased number of communications
> channels. Two people can only talk to each other; there\'s only a single
> comm path. Three workers have three communications paths; 4 have 6. In
> fact, the growth of links is exponential\...Pretty soon memos and
> meetings eat up the entire work day.
> 
> The solution is clear: break teams into smaller, autonomous and
> independent units to reduce these communications links.
> 
> Similarly, cut programs into smaller units. Since a large part of the
> problem stems from dependencies (global variables, data passed between
> functions, shared hardware, etc.), find a way to partition the program
> to eliminate --- or minimize --- the dependencies between units.
