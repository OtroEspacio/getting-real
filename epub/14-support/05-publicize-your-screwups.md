Publicize Your Screwups
=======================

Get bad news out there and out of the way
-----------------------------------------

If something goes wrong, tell people. Even if they never saw it in the
first place.

For example, Basecamp was down once for a few hours in the middle of the
night. 99% of our customers never knew, but we still posted an
\"unexpected downtime\" notice to our Everything Basecamp blog. We
thought our customers deserved to know.

Here\'s a sample of what we post when something goes wrong: \"We
apologize for the downtime this morning --- we had some database issues
which caused major slowdowns and downtimes for some people. We\'ve fixed
the problem and are taking steps to make sure this doesn\'t happen
again\...Thanks for your patience and, once again, we\'re sorry for the
downtime.\"

Be as open, honest, and transparent as possible. Don\'t keep secrets or
hide behind spin. An informed customer is your best customer. Plus,
you\'ll realize that most of your screwups aren\'t even that bad in the
minds of your customers. Customers are usually happy to give you a
little bit of breathing room as long as they know you\'re being honest
with them.

A side note about delivering news, bad and good: When bad news comes,
get it all out in the open at once. Good news, on the other hand, should
be trickled out slowly. If you can prolong the good vibes, do it.
