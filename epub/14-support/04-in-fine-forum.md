Use forums or chat to let customers help each other
---------------------------------------------------

Forums and web-based group chat are a great way to let customers ask
questions and help one another out. By eliminating the middleman ---
that\'s you --- you provide an open stream of communication and save
yourself time in the process.

At our product forums, customers post tips and tricks, feature requests,
stories, and more. We pop in from time to time to offer some assistance
but the forums are mainly a place for the community to help each other
and share their experiences with the product.

You\'ll be surprised how much people want to help one another.
