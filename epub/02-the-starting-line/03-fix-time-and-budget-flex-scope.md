Fix Time and Budget, Flex Scope
===============================

Launch on time and on budget
----------------------------

Here's an easy way to launch on time and on budget: keep them fixed.
Never throw more time or money at a problem, just scale back the scope.

There's a myth that goes like this: we can launch on time, on budget,
and on scope. It almost never happens and when it does quality often
suffers.

If you can't fit everything in within the time and budget allotted then
don't expand the time and budget. Instead, pull back the scope.
There's always time to add stuff later --- later is eternal, now is
fleeting.

Launching something great that's a little smaller in scope than planned
is better than launching something mediocre and full of holes because
you had to hit some magical time, budget, and scope window. Leave the
magic to Houdini. You've got a real business to run and a real product
to deliver.

Here are the benefits of fixing time and budget, and keeping scope
flexible:

-   #### Prioritization

    You have to figure out what's really important. What's going to
    make it into this initial release? This forces a constraint on you
    which will push you to make tough decisions instead of hemming and
    hawing.

-   #### Reality

    Setting expectations is key. If you try to fix time, budget, and
    scope, you won't be able to deliver at a high level of quality.
    Sure, you can probably deliver something, but is "something" what
    you really want to deliver?

-   #### Flexibility

    The ability to change is key. Having everything fixed makes it tough
    to change. Injecting scope flexibility will introduce options based
    on your real experience building the product. Flexibility is your
    friend.

Our recommendation: Scope down. It's better to make half a product than
a half-assed product (more on this later).
