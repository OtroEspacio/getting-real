Fund Yourself
=============

Outside money is plan B
-----------------------

The first priority of many startups is acquiring funding from investors.
But remember, if you turn to outsiders for funding, you'll have to
answer to them too. Expectations are raised. Investors want their money
back --- and quickly. The sad fact is cashing in often begins to trump
building a quality product.

These days it doesn't take much to get rolling. Hardware is cheap and
plenty of great infrastructure software is open source and free. And
passion doesn't come with a price tag.

So do what you can with the cash on hand. Think hard and determine
what's really essential and what you can do without. What can you do
with three people instead of ten? What can you do with $20k instead of
$100k? What can you do in three months instead of six? What can you do
if you keep your day job and build your app on the side?

Constraints force creativity
----------------------------

Run on limited resources and you'll be forced to reckon with
constraints earlier and more intensely. And that's a good thing.
Constraints drive innovation.

Constraints also force you to get your idea out in the wild sooner
rather than later --- another good thing. A month or two out of the
gates you should have a pretty good idea of whether you're onto
something or not. If you are, you'll be self-sustainable shortly and
won't need external cash. If your idea's a lemon, it's time to go
back to the drawing board. At least you know now as opposed to months
(or years) down the road. And at least you can back out easily. Exit
plans get a lot trickier once investors are involved.

If you're creating software just to make a quick buck, it will show.
Truth is a quick payout is pretty unlikely. So focus on building a
quality tool that you and your customers can live with for a long time.
