Have an Enemy
=============

Pick a fight
------------

Sometimes the best way to know what your app should be is to know what
it shouldn't be. Figure out your app's enemy and you'll shine a light
on where you need to go.

When we decided to create project management software, we knew Microsoft
Project was the gorilla in the room. Instead of fearing the gorilla, we
used it as a motivator. We decided Basecamp would be something
completely different, the anti-Project.

We realized project management isn't about charts, graphs, reports and
statistics --- it's about communication. It also isn't about a project
manager sitting up high and broadcasting a project plan. It's about
everyone taking responsibility together to make the project work.

Our enemy was the Project Management Dictators and the tools they used
to crack the whip. We wanted to democratize project management --- make
it something everyone was a part of (including the client). Projects
turn out better when everyone takes collective ownership of the process.

When it came to Writeboard, we knew there were competitors out there
with lots of whizbang features. So we decided to emphasize a "no fuss"
angle instead. We created an app that let people share and collaborate
on ideas simply, without bogging them down with non-essential features.
If it wasn't essential, we left it out. And in just three months after
launch, over 100,000 Writeboards have been created.

When we started on Backpack our enemy was structure and rigid rules.
People should be able to organize their information their own way ---
not based on a series of preformatted screens or a plethora of required
form fields.

One bonus you get from having an enemy is a very clear marketing
message. People are stoked by conflict. And they also understand a
product by comparing it to others. With a chosen enemy, you're feeding
people a story they want to hear. Not only will they understand your
product better and faster, they'll take sides. And that's a sure-fire
way to get attention and ignite passion.

Now with all that said, it's also important to not get too obsessed
with the competition. Overanalyze other products and you'll start to
limit the way you think. Take a look and then move on to your own vision
and your own ideas.

> Marketers (and all human beings) are well trained to follow the leader.
> The natural instinct is to figure out what's working for the
> competition and then try to outdo it --- to be cheaper than your
> competitor who competes on price, or faster than the competitor who
> competes on speed. The problem is that once a consumer has bought
> someone else's story and believes that lie, persuading the consumer to
> switch is the same as persuading him to admit he was wrong. And people
> hate admitting that they're wrong.

> Instead, you must tell a different story and persuade listeners that
> your story is more important than the story they currently believe. If
> your competition is faster, you must be cheaper. If they sell the story
> of health, you must sell the story of convenience. Not just the
> positioning x/y axis sort of "We are cheaper" claim, but a real story
> that is completely different from the story that's already being told.

> One of the quickest ways to get yourself into trouble is to look at what

> However, this can quickly lead one astray. Instead, we stay focused on
> the big picture and keep asking ourselves, what is the key problem we
> are trying to solve and how can we solve it.
